        Things impossible, improbable, and technomagical
    </h4>
    <p>
        We gather curiosities, from thr four corners of this world and others, making the traces of their pottential existances available for a small fee. Beware: we do not sell the impossible, improbable, and technomagical, but rather their promise. We provide offer the perfect gift for that person who has everything: the thing that may never exist, but that elicits dreams.
